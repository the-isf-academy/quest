Quest Game Framework
====================

Quest is a Python framework for making top-down adventure games. It is designed for high school 
students in their first or second year of computer science. Quest was developed as part of FabLearn's 
secondary computer science curriculum, which will be released free and open source in 2020.

Quest is built on top of Paul Vincent Craven's excellent :doc:`arcade:index` framework. Quest is more 
user-friendly but more limited. The code is written to be read by novices, there is extensive documentation,
and more design patterns are baked in. 

Quest is under active development. If you find any bugs or have ideas for how to make it better, please 
raise an issue at `Quest's home on GitHub <https://github.com/cproctor/quest>`_ or contact 
`Chris Proctor <https://chrisproctor.net>`_.
