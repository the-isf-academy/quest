    The base class for sprites in Quest.

    A :py:class:`QuestSprite` is a subclass of :py:class:`arcade.Sprite` with a
    few additional methods to help integrate into the Quest framework.

    Attributes:
        description: A string description of the sprite.
        strategy: If set, should be a :py:class:`quest.strategy.Strategy`, or another class
            instance with a :py:meth:`choose_course` method.
        speed: The sprite's speed.

    Arguments:
        filename: The only required argument is the name of the sprite's image file.
        kwargs: There are many optional keyword arguments inherited from :py:class:`arcade.Sprite`.
