    :py:class:`QuestGame` is the central class in the :doc:`../index`,
    which is built on top of :doc:`arcade:index`. :py:class:`QuestGame`
    is a subclass of :py:class:`arcade:arcade.Window`.
    To create your own game, create a subclass of :py:class:`QuestGame`
    and then override whatever you need to change from the default behavior.

    When :py:class:`QuestGame` is initialized, it sets up the player, the maps,
    the walls, the NPCs, the physics engine, and centers the viewport on the player.
    Rather than overriding :py:meth:`__init__`, consider overriding just the setup
    functions you need to change.

    Attributes:
        screen_width: Width in pixels of the game window.
        screen_height: Height in pixels of the game window.
        left_viewport_margin: Minimum distance (in pixels) between the
            player sprite and the left edge of the viewport.
        right_viewport_margin: Minimum distance (in pixels) between the
            player sprite and the right edge of the viewport.
        bottom_viewport_margin: Minimum distance (in pixels) between the
            player sprite and the bottom edge of the viewport.
        top_viewport_margin: Minimum distance (in pixels) between the
            player sprite and the top edge of the viewport.
        screen_title: Title of the game window (displayed top center)
        player_scaling: Factor by which to scale the player sprite.
        player_sprite_image: Filepath for the player sprite.
        player_speed: In pixels per update. (By default, the game runs
            at 60 hertz, so update is called every 1/60 second.)
        player_initial_x: Initial x-coordinate for player center.
        player_initial_y: Initial y-coordinate for player center.
        view_bottom: y-coordinate of the bottom edge of the current viewport
        view_left: x-coordinate of the left edge of the current viewport
